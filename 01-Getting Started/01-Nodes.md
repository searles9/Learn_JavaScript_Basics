# What is JavaScript?:
* JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages
* With JS you can build:
    * web and mobile apps
    * real time networking apps
    * command line tools
    * games
* JS code can run in....
  * in the browser - it originally was only able to run in the browser
    * every browser has a JS engine
    * chrome uses v8
    * firefox uses SpiderMonkey
  * Node
    * node is a runtime enviorment
    * its an embedded version of the chrome v8 runtime in a C++ program
    * this allows you to run the JS code outside of a browser
* JS vs ECMAScript?:
  * ECMAScript is just a specification (kinda like Pythons PEP8)
    * ES6 is the newer release of ECMAScript
  * JS is a programming language that conforms to that specification
